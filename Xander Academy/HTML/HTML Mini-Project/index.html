<!-- This page will contain your blog posts, and links to about.html and contact.html.

Each blog post should contain:

 <!-- Questions for later:
 how does css inheritance work?
 .header_naviation_elements {} will not change the <a> tags,
    that requires .header_navigation_elements{} a. why?  -->

<!-- NOTE: theres a lot of comments on the first post. its just explanations of what/why i did things bc i will forget later :) -->
