        <p>I have had an interest in the markets ever since joining Xander Talent.</p>
        <p>This website is meant to contain as many unique elements as it could, that is why it may seem chaotic</p>
        <p>Content-wise, I wanted to keep it to my interests, while keeping it entertaining rather than educational or simply archival</p>
        <p>Everything on here is a joke and by no means meant to be taken seriously</p>
        <p>There is no point, hidden message/ meaning, insinuation or anything other than a light-hearted joke</p>
        <p>The articles are from the ft, 'memey' pictures from r/wallstreetbets, stock images from yahoo finance and whatever google uses</p>
        <p>I just grouped the relevant pictures together, they are not accurate.</p>
        <p>refer to the github here as well</p>
