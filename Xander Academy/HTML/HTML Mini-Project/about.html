                    <p>I grew up and went to school in Cape Town, South Africa. I would longboard after school with my friends, mountain bike with my family and sometimes go surfing (something that I wish I did more of).</p>
                    <p>After high school I moved to the UK for university. I studied Computer Science at the university of Greenwich.</p>
                    <p>Some exciting projects that I worked on include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reinforcement Learning for the Container Loading Problem</li>
                            <li>Shortest Path Algorithm with Dijkstra for London Underground</li>
                            <li>Multi-Threaded Command Line Interface Application with Python Sockets</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>While studying I worked as an assistant to the Timetable Officer for the Business Faculty. I worked there for two and a half years.</p>
                    <p>I am happy with how I spent my time and a glad with where I turned out.</p>
                    <p>Some further information can be found on my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-torrington/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

                    <p>I have had an interest in the markets ever since joining Xander Talent.</p>
                    <p>Content-wise, I wanted to keep it to my interests, while keeping it entertaining rather than educational or simply archival</p>
                    <p>Everything on here is a joke and by no means meant to be taken seriously</p>
                    <p>There is no point, hidden message/ meaning, insinuation or anything other than a light-hearted joke</p>
                    <p>The articles are from the ft, 'memey' pictures from r/wallstreetbets, stock images from yahoo finance and whatever the google finance</p>
                    <p>I just grouped the relevant pictures together, they are not accurate.</p>
