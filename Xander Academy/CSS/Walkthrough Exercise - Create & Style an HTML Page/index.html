    <p>I grew up and went to school in Cape Town, South Africa. I would longboard after school with my friends, mountain bike with my family and sometimes go surfing (something that I wish I did more of).</p>
    <p>After high school I moved to the UK for university. I studied Computer Science at the university of Greenwich.</p>
    <p>Some exciting projects that I worked on include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reinforcement Learning for the Container Loading Problem</li>
        <li>Shortest Path Algorithm with Dijkstra for London Underground</li>
        <li>Multi-Threaded Command Line Interface Application with Python Sockets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While studying I worked as an assistant to the Timetable Officer for the Business Faculty. I worked there for two and a half years.</p>
    <p>I am happy with how I spent my time and a glad with where I turned out.</p>
