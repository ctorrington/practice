        <p class = "name">How's it? My name is <span>Christopher Torrington</span></p>
        <p>I grew up and went to school in Cape Town, South Africa, <i>obviously</i>. I would longboard after school with my friends, mountain bike with my family and sometimes go surfing (something that I wish I did more of).</p>
        <p>After high school I moved to the UK for university. I studied Computer Science at the university of Greenwich.</p>
        <p>Some exciting projects that I worked on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning for the Container Loading Problem</li>
            <li>Shortest Path Algorithm with Dijkstra for London Underground</li>
            <li>Multi-Threaded Command Line Interface Application with Python Sockets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While studying I worked as an assistant to the Timetable Officer for the Business Faculty. I worked there for two and a half years.</p>
        <p>I am happy with how I spent my time and a glad with where I turned out.</p>
        <p>Some further information can be found on my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-torrington/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
        <p>My past, current and future projects can be found on my <a href = "https://github.com/ctorrington">Github</a>.</p>

                                    This should be fairly concise while also describing the key
                                    components that you developed or worked on. It can be as long as you need it
                                    to be but should at least be a few sentences long. Be sure to include
                                    specific links anywhere in the description. A link looks like
                                    <a href = "https://frontendmasters.github.io/grid-flexbox-v2/">this</a>, and
                                    multiple links look <a href = "#">like this</a> and <a href = "#">like this</a>.
