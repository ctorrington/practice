# A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. 
# It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. 
# Django follows the DRY Principle. 
# The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.


# Here, each model is represented by a class that subclasses django.db.models.Model. 
# Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.


# Create your models here.
